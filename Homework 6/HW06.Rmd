## Topic 5: Work with a list

Load in the `purrr` tutorial packages for data on Game of Thrones:

```{r}
library(purrr)
library(repurrrsive)
```

### Exercise 1: `max.level`

Read the documentation on `str()`. What does `max.level` control? Apply `str()` to `wesanderson` and/or  `got_chars` and experiment with `max.level = 0`, `max.level = 1`, and `max.level = 2`. Which will you use in practice with deeply nested lists?

According to `?str()` [documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/str.html) `max.level` is the:

> maximal level of nesting which is applied for displaying nested structures, e.g., a list containing sub lists. Default `NA`: Display all nesting levels.

```{r}
str(got_chars, max.level = 0)
```

A simple-as-possible summary about the structure of this nested dataframe that includes data for 30 characters.

```{r}
str(got_chars, max.level = 1)
```

Looking at the next level of the nested dataframe, it's shown that each character has 18 categories of information included in the data.

```{r}
str(got_chars, max.level = 2)
```

I apologize for making you scroll past all that. This is the entire nested dataframe, which is the same as the default `max.level=NA`.

Therefore, in my own words I would say that `max.level` essentially selects the level of the nested dataframe that you would like to see!

Which `max.level` you select for a given nested dataframe depends on how deeply nested it is, I would suggest `max.level=1` or so for a good general sense of the data since `max.level=0` wasn't very informative and `max.level=2` spit out too much data *in this case.*

### Exercise 2: `list.len`

What does the `list.len` argument of `str()` control? What is its default value? Call `str()` on `got_chars` and then on a single component of `got_chars` with `list.len` set to a value much smaller than the default. What range of values do you think you’ll use in real life?

Again, according to `?str()` documentation, `list.len` is:

> numeric; maximum number of list elements to display within a level.

and the default value is 99.

```{r}
str(got_chars, list.len = 5)
```

When `str()` options are set to `list.len=5`, the returned output is cut off for the first five characters and the first five categories of data for each particular character (url, id, name, gender, culture).

```{r}
str(got_chars[30], list.len = 6)
```

When viewing just one character (Sansa, listed as #30) `list.len` returns however many categories of data for that character you requested. I chose `list.len=6` as the point for truncation because the next category is when/if the character died and I'm too far behind on the show to willingly submit myself (or other people) to spoilers!

In an example other than this, I think that the `list.len` to be selected depends on the data or list you're working with, similar to the `max.level` option. But around 5-10 might be the most ideal because any smaller wouldn't give you much information and any larger and you might be better off viewing the entire thing by using `View()` for dataframes or `jsonedit()` for lists (in package `listviewer`).

### Exercise 3: `max.level` and `list.len` on `got_chars`

Call `str()` on `got_chars`, specifying both `max.level` and `list.len`.

```{r}
str(got_chars, max.level = 1, list.len = 5)
```

This is a much more simple version of what was returned when `max.level=1` was used without setting `list.len` and it returned all 30 lines of code that said the exact same thing. This is very helpful for not getting huge outputs to scroll past in an RMarkdown file.

### Exercise 4: `max.level` and `list.len` on `got_chars` element

Call `str()` on the first element of `got_chars`, i.e. the first Game of Thrones character. Use what you’ve learned to pick an appropriate combination of `max.level` and `list.len`.

```{r}
str(got_chars[1], max.level = 2, list.len = 6)
```

So, for Theon Greyjoy, I've set `list.len=6` once again because of spoiler prevention reasons since I'm not sure how old or updated this list is and I'm not quite up to date on who's still alive in the show.

And I've set `max.level=2` which is the same as `max.level=NA` or omitting `max.level` entirely, because this is the only level where the data is actually interesting and informative. I checked and didn't include the code for simplicity but `max.level=1` returned `List of 1
 $ :List of 18` and `max.level=0` returned `List of 1` as an output.

## Topic 3: Work with the candy data

Note: I've ordered the homework out of numerical order as task #5 and *then* task #3 because that's the order I completed them in and I utilize what we learned above for `str()` in the following task!

First read in the file and load relevant packages:

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
library(stringr)
library(forcats)

candy <- read.csv(file="candy.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, strip.white=TRUE, na.strings=c("NA",""))

str(candy, list.len=6)
```

Without using `list.len`, the output of `str()` or `head()` or any other show-a-small-bit-of-data command will print all 126 column names, some of which are really long, such as the candy Peanut Butter Kisses which they categorize as "Anonymous brown globs that come in black and orange wrappers." The reason I know the real name of these candies is because I stumbled upon a very heated comment in the CSV file when I was scrolling through it in Excel, you can read it below.

```{r}
candy[1669, 99]
```

What I gather from this data so far is people are surprisingly passionate about candy choice!! 

### Task choice

Hard: Looking for ‘structure’ in the data. For example, are there classes of individuals with similar candy preference profiles? 

I'll investigate Betty vs. Veronica fans, trick-or-treaters vs. non-trick-or-treaters and white-gold vs. blue-black perspectives on the 2015 viral dress (from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/2xahnt/what_color_is_this_dress_blueblack_or_whitegold/)) to try to find trends!

An even more ambitious task that I didn't have time to get to today could be searching through the additional comments using some type of `str_`command such as `str_match` to find common patterns and see how that affects candy choice. i.e. respondants requesting a "Meh" category in addition to the "Despair" and "Joy" categories may be younger people (millenials) who prefer different types of candy than older people who had different selections of candy available to them while growing up that they have associated with nostalgia and joy.

### Data wrangling

First, let's simplify some of those really long column names here:

```{r}
candy <- rename(candy, trickortreat = Are.you.going.actually.going.trick.or.treating.yourself., dress = X.That.dress..that.went.viral.early.this.year...when.I.first.saw.it..it.was.________., age = How.old.are.you.)
#replace long names with something simple

colnames(candy) <- str_replace(colnames(candy), "X", "")
colnames(candy) <- str_replace_all(colnames(candy), "[.]", "")
#get rid of extra X's and periods in column names

str(candy, list.len=6)
#make sure it worked!
```

Before beginning to filter the dataset to include the different groups of people, the data should be reshaped into long format. And while we're at it, let's ditch all of the not relevant columns as well!

```{r}
longcandy <- candy %>%
  select(BettyorVeronica, trickortreat, age, dress, Butterfinger:YorkPeppermintPatties, Seasaltflavoredstuffprobablychocolatesincethisistheitflavoroftheyear, NeccoWafers) %>%
  gather(Candy, Feeling, Butterfinger:NeccoWafers, na.rm = TRUE)

head(longcandy)
```

#### Betty versus Veronica

```{r}
#will wrangle each subsetted dataframe the same way
betty <- longcandy %>%
  #filter to include only the relevant group
  filter(BettyorVeronica=="Betty") %>%
  #select only the immediately relevant variables
  select(BettyorVeronica, Candy, Feeling) %>%
  #count the total of joy and despair responses per candy
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  #spread to have joy and despair columns, 1 row per candy
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  #and mutate to find how the group feels overall per candy
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR)

veronica <- longcandy %>%
  filter(BettyorVeronica=="Veronica")%>%
  select(BettyorVeronica, Candy, Feeling)%>%
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR)

noarchie <- longcandy %>%
  filter(BettyorVeronica=="???")%>%
  select(BettyorVeronica, Candy, Feeling)%>%
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR)
```

Creating mini-dataframes to analyze for the Betty's and Veronica's of the world and I've also added another one for respondants who answered the question with "???" implying that they don't know Archie comics and who these characters are or they just can't decide! And responses left blank (`NA`) are not included here for simplicity of analysis.

#### Trick-or-treaters!

```{r}
trick <- longcandy %>%
  filter(trickortreat=="Yes")%>%
  select(trickortreat, Candy, Feeling)%>%
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR)

notrick <- longcandy %>%
  filter(trickortreat=="No")%>%
  select(trickortreat, Candy, Feeling)%>%
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR)

youngtrick <- longcandy %>%
  filter(trickortreat=="Yes" & age<15)%>%
  select(trickortreat, Candy, Feeling)%>%
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR)
```

More filtered dataframes for trick-or-treaters versus non-trick-or-treaters and another category for young trick-or-treaters since parents of kids going trick-or-treating will likely have different preferences as their little sugar monsters, we shall see!

#### What color do you see in that dress?

```{r}
blueblack <- longcandy %>%
  filter(dress=="Blue and black")%>%
  select(dress, Candy, Feeling)%>%
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR)
  
whitegold <- longcandy %>%
  filter(dress=="White and gold")%>%
  select(dress, Candy, Feeling)%>%
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR)
```

A final set of simplified dataframes to be explored and analyzed, this one indicating what people see out of the optical illusion phenomenon that was this cheap dress posted on the internet awhile back.

### Data Exploration/Analysis

#### Tables

```{r}
bettytop5 <- top_n(betty, 5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate the best 5 candies for betty fans

bettylow5 <- top_n(betty, -5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate the worst 5 candies for betty fans

bettyinfo <- data.frame(bettytop5, bettylow5)
colnames(bettyinfo) <- c("Top Five", "Bottom Five")
#combine into a dataframe to make a table

veronicatop5 <- top_n(veronica, 5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate the best 5 candies for veronica fans

veronicalow5 <- top_n(veronica, -5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate the worst 5 candies for veronica fans

veronicainfo <- data.frame(veronicatop5, veronicalow5)
colnames(veronicainfo) <- c("Top Five", "Bottom Five")
#combine into a dataframe to make a table

neithertop5 <- top_n(noarchie, 6, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate the best 5 candies for fans of neither
  
neitherlow5 <- top_n(noarchie, -5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate the worst 5 candies for fans of neither

neitherinfo <- data.frame(neithertop5, neitherlow5)
colnames(neitherinfo) <- c("Top Five", "Bottom Five")
#combine into a dataframe to make a table

knitr::kable(bettyinfo, format = "markdown", col.names = c("Betty Top Five", "Betty Bottom Five"))

knitr::kable(veronicainfo, format = "markdown", col.names = c("Veronica Top Five", "Veronica Bottom Five"))

knitr::kable(neitherinfo, format = "markdown", col.names = c("??? Top Six", "??? Bottom Six"))
```

Okay, so we can see here that people who identify strongly with a Betty or Veronica type are **_exactly_ the same in preferences!** Whereas, people who don't identify one way or the other, enjoy similar types of chocolate based candy treats but interestingly, 2nd on their list is cash money! And they also hate Creepy religious comics a lot more... (Maybe that's what they think Archie comics are?!)

I would also like to note here that `top_n()` will return multiple values when there is a "tie" and so that is why the top five for "???" respondants is actually a top six, it is due to a tie!

```{r}
tricktop5 <- top_n(trick, 5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate best 5 candies for trick or treaters

tricklow5 <- top_n(trick, -5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate worst 5 candies for trick or treaters

trickinfo <- data.frame(tricktop5, tricklow5)
colnames(trickinfo) <- c("Top Five", "Bottom Five")
#combine into a dataframe to make a table

notricktop5 <- top_n(notrick, 5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate best 5 candies for non-trick or treaters

notricklow5 <- top_n(notrick, -5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate worst 5 candies for non-trick or treaters

notrickinfo <- data.frame(notricktop5, notricklow5)
colnames(notrickinfo) <- c("Top Five", "Bottom Five")
#combine into a dataframe to make a table

youngtricktop5 <- top_n(youngtrick, 6, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate best 5 candies for young trick or treaters

youngtricklow5 <- top_n(youngtrick, -7, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate worst 5 candies for young trick or treaters

youngtrickinfo <- data.frame(youngtricktop5, youngtricklow5)
colnames(youngtrickinfo) <- c("Top Five", "Bottom Five")
#combine into a dataframe to make a table

knitr::kable(trickinfo, format = "markdown", col.names = c("Trick-or-Treater Top Five", "Trick-or-Treater Bottom Five"))

knitr::kable(notrickinfo, format = "markdown", col.names = c("Non-Trick-or-Treater Top Seven", "Non-Trick-or-Treater Bottom Seven"))

knitr::kable(youngtrickinfo, format = "markdown", col.names = c("Young Trick-or-Treater Top Seven", "Young Trick-or-Treater Bottom Seven"))
```

Again, I've included more than a top five in the case of multiple ties for under 15 year old trick-or-treaters where they have a top seven.

We can see that trick or treaters and non-trick or treaters are fairly similar in taste, except for disagreeing on what's worse, a kale smoothie or white bread. The answers are also similar to the previous Betty/Veronica debate showing some candy is universal. However, the real differences can be seen with whether or not the trick or treaters are still in their adolescence or childhood. They have completely different preferences and the only candies they have in common with other's choices are any full size candy bar, kit kats, reeses peanut butter cups (I agree with these!) for positives and broken glowsticks and dental paraphenalia as the only consistently seen negatives.

```{r}
bbtop5 <- top_n(blueblack, 5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate best 5 candies for blue-black dress people

bblow5 <- top_n(blueblack, -5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate worst 5 candies for blue-black dress people

bbinfo <- data.frame(bbtop5, bblow5)
colnames(bbinfo) <- c("Top Five", "Bottom Five")
#combine into a dataframe to make a table

wgtop5 <- top_n(whitegold, 5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate best 5 candies for white-gold dress people

wglow5 <- top_n(whitegold, -5, NetFeels) %>%
  select(Candy)
#calculate worst 5 candies for white-gold dress people

wginfo <- data.frame(wgtop5, wglow5)
colnames(wginfo) <- c("Top Five", "Bottom Five")
#combine into a dataframe to make a table

knitr::kable(bbinfo, format = "markdown", col.names = c("Blue-Black Top Five", "Blue-Black Bottom Five"))

knitr::kable(wginfo, format = "markdown", col.names = c("White-Gold Top Five", "White-Gold Bottom Five"))
```

This one is super boring because I guess people who percieve optical illusions differently aren't inherently different in personality and subsequent candy choice. But now we know!

#### Graphs

```{r}
#same data manipulation as before for subsets, but for entire dataset!
widecandy <- longcandy %>%
  select(Candy, Feeling)%>%
  count(Candy, Feeling, sort=TRUE) %>%
  spread(Feeling, n) %>%
  mutate(NetFeels = JOY - DESPAIR) %>%
  #and change despair to a negative feeling value
  mutate(Despair=DESPAIR*-1) %>%
	#then drop the original positive DESPAIR column for simplicity
	select(-DESPAIR) %>%
  #then finally combine three columns into one for graph
  gather(Feeling, Magnitude, JOY:Despair)

#make sure it worked out okay
head(widecandy)
```

```{r}
ggplot(widecandy, aes(fct_reorder(Candy, Magnitude, .desc = TRUE), Magnitude))+
  geom_point(aes(color=Feeling))+
	scale_x_discrete(label=function(x) abbreviate(x, minlength = 7))+
	theme_classic()+
	theme(axis.text.x=element_text(size=5, angle = 90))+
	xlab("Candy")
```

Here's the graph showing overall feelings towards candy! And since it looks horrible to plot that many categories I've also included them in a table below where they're ranked best to worst!

```{r message=FALSE}
knitr::kable(levels(fct_reorder(widecandy$Candy, widecandy$Magnitude, .desc = TRUE)), format = "markdown")
```

### Troubleshooting/Links

* I kept getting an [error when reading in](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18444769/error-while-reading-csv-file-in-r) the candy datafile but Stack Overflow said it's due to symbols like é that R doesn't like.
* Reminder on [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) from a Github user's Cheatsheet.
* RStudio [Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for ggplot and dplyr for important things to remember!
* It took a bit of time to recode the candy column names and I found an R help page that said to use [colnames()](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/renaming-column-names-td893814.html) which makes a lot of sense.
* Also from R help on column names, it was hard to replace the periods because R uses "." to mean *any* letter but "[.]" will [replace periods.](http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Replacing-Period-in-String-td3392620.html)
* Help with [forcats reordering](http://stat545.com/block029_factors.html) from STAT545 lecture on factor levels
* Inspiration for the [candy analysis](https://boingboing.net/2015/10/31/the-candy-hierarchy-2015-your.html), it's pretty cool stuff to check out if you didn't tackle this task in the assignment!

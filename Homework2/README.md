### Challenges and solutions

#### Github troubles

Honestly this was the toughest part of the entire assignment, trying to get all the necessary files into the Homework 2 subfolder!

I tried to search google for how to move files, found out how to move some files into folders by editing the name and using / or backspace.

But I struggled with being able to move the hw02_files that contained the uneditable figures needed for the Rmd and md files...

The solution was to manually upload the figures from my local computer into the folders that I (also manually) created with the same name 
"hw02_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers" so the Rmd and md files knew where to refer to within the Homework 2 folder.

It took a lot of searches, commits, edits, deletions and frustration but I eventually got everything I needed into that pesky folder!

#### R Markdown coding

Creating the RMarkdown file was fairly easy given the resources and skills both from this course and the Biol 501 R course I'm also taking.

I did need to search how to create a density plot however but luckily [Rbloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/density-plot-with-ggplot/) 
was there to show me the code for this type of graph.

I did also have to refer back to the class notes a lot to refine my figures and their code, especially for the ggplot and dplyr functions.

I once forgot a bracket in a piece of code and couldn't figure out why I was getting an error message but I eventually found the problem!

#### Readme file

Edited within Github since I'm more familiar with the syntax at this point.

No problems encountered here, links were easily added!

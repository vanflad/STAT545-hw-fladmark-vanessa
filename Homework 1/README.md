(Homework Assignment 1)[https://github.com/vanflad/STAT545-hw-fladmark-vanessa/blob/master/Homework%201/hw01_gapminder.md]

ReadME file

Edited with GitHub since it seemed easier
But it resulted in a lot of commits
I couldn't get some of the gifs and pictures to work
But with trial and error I found ones that looked nice
I'm overall very happy with the cool looking file!
R Markdown file

Edited with RStudio because it was easier
Getting the repo into RStudio was difficult
But the STAT545 website reminded me how to do it!
Putting the code in was fairly easy and simple
Making the list was tricky, it didn't work at first
I looked at R Markdown basics on the RStudio website
Used numbers in list since I couldn't figure out bullet points
Used double space after each line to create the line breaks
The headers were easy and I committed and pushed to GitHub!

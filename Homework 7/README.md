# Homework 7

## Automating Data Analysis Pipelines

### November 15th, 2017

For this particular assignment I have many links to refer you to:

* [Markdown](https://github.com/vanflad/STAT547-hw-fladmark-vanessa/blob/master/Homework%207/HW07.md) file for nice compiled report!

* [RMarkdown](https://github.com/vanflad/STAT547-hw-fladmark-vanessa/blob/master/Homework%207/HW07.Rmd) file for details behind the Markdown file.

* [Main R script](https://github.com/vanflad/STAT547-hw-fladmark-vanessa/blob/master/Homework%207/hw07-master.R) where all R scripts and Markdown were sourced! 

* [First R script](https://github.com/vanflad/STAT547-hw-fladmark-vanessa/blob/master/Homework%207/hw07-1.R) where data was initially explored and reordered

* [Second R script](https://github.com/vanflad/STAT547-hw-fladmark-vanessa/blob/master/Homework%207/hw07-2.R) where filtering and linear model outputs are written to files

* [Third R script](https://github.com/vanflad/STAT547-hw-fladmark-vanessa/blob/master/Homework%207/hw07-3.R) where the final graphs and another nice table are made!

* And while I'm at it a link to the issue/[peer review](https://github.com/vanflad/STAT547-hw-fladmark-vanessa/issues/7) page!

Now that I understand data analysis pipelines, I've learned that not all types of pipelines are bad!

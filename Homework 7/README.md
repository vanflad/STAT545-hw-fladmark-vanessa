##Automating Data Analysis Pipelines

### November 15th, 2017

For this particular assignment I have many links to refer you to:

* [Markdown]() file for nice compiled report!

* [RMarkdown]() file for details behind the Markdown file.

* [Main R script]() where all R scripts and Markdown were sourced! 

* [First R script]() where data was initially explored and reordered

* [Second R script]() where filtering and linear model outputs are written to files

* [Third R script]() where the final graphs and another nice table are made!

* And while I'm at it a link to the issue/[peer review]() page!

Now that I understand data analysis pipelines, I've learned that not types of pipelines are bad!

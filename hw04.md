### Part 1: Data reshaping

### Part 2: Join, merge, look up

#### Prompt choice: Activity 2

Create own cheatsheet on how to use join's on the pets I've owned.

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(readr)

pets <- "
name, breed, color
Sheba, mutt, black
Precious, Chesapeake-lab, black
Vinnie, Chocolate lab, brown
Dude, American longhair, orange
Angel, American shorthair, orange(calico)
Princess, American shorthair, orange(calico)
Cheezy, American shorthair, orange(tortoiseshell)
Loki, American longhair, white
Misty, American shorthair, grey(tabby)
Goldeen, Goldfish, orange
Swordie, Swordtail, grey
"
pets <- read_csv(pets, trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 1)

breeds <- "
animal, breed, fur
dog, Chesapeake-lab, short
dog, Chocolate lab, short
cat, American longhair, long
cat, American shorthair, short
fish, Goldfish, none
fish, Swordtail, none
fish, Guppy, none
"
breeds <- read_csv(breeds, trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 1)
```

First load the library and the two relevant dataframe files.

I will be modelling this "cheatsheet" after Jenny's, utilizing the same variations of inner\_join( ), left\_join( ), full\_join( ), semi\_join( ) and anti\_join( ) and investigating the order in which you attach the dataframes (i.e. "pets" first versus "breeds" first) since these are all the possible iterations of "join" to explore.

Note: right\_join( ) is another join function in dplyr but it has the opposite effect of left\_join( ) and since order of dataframes is alternated, right\_join( ) is omitted here for simplicity.

##### inner\_join(pets, breeds)

##### semi\_join(pets, breeds)

##### left\_join(pets, breeds)

##### anti\_join(pets, breeds)

##### inner\_join(breeds, pets)

##### semi\_join(breeds, pets)

##### left\_join(breeds, pets)

##### anti\_join(breeds, pets)

##### full\_join(breeds, pets)

# Homework Assignment 1

## ReadME file

- Edited with GitHub since it seemed easier
- But it resulted in a lot of commits
- I couldn't get some of the gifs and pictures to work
- But with trial and error I found ones that looked nice
- I'm overall very happy with the cool looking file!

## R Markdown file

- Edited with RStudio because it was easier
- Getting the repo into RStudio was difficult
- But the STAT545 website reminded me how to do it!
- Putting the code in was fairly easy and simple
- Making the list was tricky, it didn't work at first
- I looked at R Markdown basics on the RStudio website
- Used numbers in list since I couldn't figure out bullet points
- Used double space after each line to create the line breaks
- The headers were easy and I committed and pushed to GitHub!

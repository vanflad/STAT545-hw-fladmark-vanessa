### Troubleshooting and Links

This is the first assignment I tried to tackle on my home PC whereas previously I thought it was easier to work on my laptop since Git, Github and RStudio were all already working great on there due to the in-class demos.

I unfortunately encountered some old "newbie" issues when setting up the Github and RStudio connection since I only did it once before and didn't remember from back in the first class.

When I tried to make my first commit, I encountered an error where even though RStudio "pulled" my repo just fine, it still wasn't sure what Github account it was supposed to connect to so [Slack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11656761/git-please-tell-me-who-you-are-error) helped and I found out I had to type the command into Git not into R.

Additionally, I did not know the PC [shortcut for creating a code chunk](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30938280/keyboard-shortcut-to-produce-code-chunk-brackets-in-markdown-in-r-for-rstudio) in R Markdown since my laptop is a Mac, and Stack Overflow came to the rescue once again!

I also had issues with getting gapminder to work because [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) both needed to be updated...

All in all, I was just fine figuring out the coding for this assignment but it was a big pain in the behind to get everything working properly on my machine.

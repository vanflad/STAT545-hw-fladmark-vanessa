### Links to files

The R Markdown file can be found [here](https://github.com/vanflad/STAT545-hw-fladmark-vanessa/blob/master/Homework2/hw02.Rmd)

### Challenges and solutions

#### Github troubles

This was the toughest part of the assignment, trying to get all the necessary files into the Homework 2 subfolder!

I searched google for how to move files, I could move some files into folders by [editing the name](https://help.github.com/articles/moving-a-file-to-a-new-location/) and using /.

But I couldn't move the hw02_files that contained the uneditable figures needed for the Rmd and md files...

The solution was to manually upload the figures from my computer into the folders that I (also manually) created with the same name 
"hw02_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers" so the Rmd and md files knew where to refer to within the Homework 2 folder.

It took many searches, commits, edits, deletions and frustration but I eventually got everything into that folder!

#### R Markdown coding

Creating the RMarkdown file was fairly easy given the resources and skills both from this course and Biol 501.

I did need to search how to create a density plot however but luckily [Rbloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/density-plot-with-ggplot/) 
was there to show me the right code.

I did also have to refer back to the class notes a lot to refine my figures and code, especially for ggplot and dplyr functions.

I once forgot a bracket in a piece of code and couldn't figure out why I was getting an error but I eventually solved it!

#### Readme file

Edited within Github since I'm more familiar with the syntax at this point.

No problems encountered here, links were easily added!
